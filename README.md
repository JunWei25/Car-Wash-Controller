# LabView
Designed a simple Car Wash Controller Using LabView.  There are two types of car wash for the user to choose, "Deluxe Wash" and "Economy Wash". "Economy Wash" has only 1 cycle whereas "Deluxe Wash" has 3 cycles. The car wash will stop when the car is out of position and no time will be lost.

### After a car wash selection has been made the traffic light on both ends will turn end to inform other users that a car wash is in progress and should not enter.

### Throughout the car wash announcement will be made to prompt the user about the next step.

### Once the car wash has completed it will be recorded down into the system.

## Future Enhancement
- Implement a security system. 
- Implement a system where the supply can be controlled so that resources will be used efficiently.
